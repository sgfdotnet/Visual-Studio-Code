* Research Git
* Research Terminal
* Create .Net Demo
* Create Debug Demo

## Intro

* History
    * "Code editing. Redefined."
    * Announced at the 2015 Build conference
    * Released later that year
    * Since that time have had a roughly monthly release cadence
    * They have added a bunch of stuff
    * Support seems to be very good
    * Latest version added: XXXX
* Basics
    * Based on Electron
    * It is not a form of Atom which is a different text/code editor
    * It is fully cross platform so it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux
    * I believe that the experience on all of them is the same
* What do people use it for?
    * People use it for everything, Javascript, Go, Python, stuff you have never heard of
    * But of course MS shows it off as part of their .Net Core platform
    * This is fully cross platform .Net framework
    * It is NOT a VS replacement, at least in terms of feature Set
    * Speaking personally, it has replaced VS for a good portion of my personal development
    * I used to use a mixture of Notepad++, Visual Studio, and more when doing web development
    * This was often combined by a few terminal windows, or CMD.exe on Windows
    * VS has replaced all of that
    * It has also taken over the role at work of viewing/examining SQL files
    * Instances where I just need to jump in, look at or copy a file, then move on
    * Opens WAY faster than SQL Management Studio or Visual Studio
    * I also use it for note-taking/task lists
* What we are going to cover today
    * How do we install it
    * What does it look like, and an overview of the UI
        * This includes useful shortcuts, the terminal, and wtf the "command palette" is
    * Extensions
        * This is where the real power of VS Code is, a massive and growing ecosystem
        * Has a ton of stuff from language support to fancy git tools 
        * All free, and something you can add today
    * Git
        * We will discuss how VS Code can interact with git
        * It is what the VS Code team uses, and it is the only Version Control in VS Code
        * I'm sure you can already see the little git symbol over on the Side
    * Terminal
        * Lets talk about Terminal
        * That little window at the bottom
        * On Windows it uses Powershell, on other OS's it uses the shell
    * .Net Core
        * We will close out by installing and working with .Net Core
        * This gives us a chance to talk about the actual coding
        * Will also let us use the built in debugging features, in this case for C#
* Feel free to interrupt at any time
